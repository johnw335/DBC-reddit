DBC-reddit
==========


### Team: Patrick, Emily, John, & Alex

<p>Our project is to build a DBC specific version of Reddit, that would allow a user to login through socrates and view, create, edit and delete a post. Users would also be able to vote on comments and posts, and would have a home page that shows the most popular and recent posts from their subreddits.</p>
